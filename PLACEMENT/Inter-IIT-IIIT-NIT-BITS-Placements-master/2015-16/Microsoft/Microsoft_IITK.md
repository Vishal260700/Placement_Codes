#Group Fly

Two questions :

1. Given a general binary tree (not necessarily full or complete, just any binary tree), assume every node has three pointers - left, right, next. Use next pointer to link together all nodes that are in the same level.
2. Given a string, replace all consecutive occurrences of a character by a single instance. Eg: tommorrow â‡’ tomorow.
