##Finding cycles in a graph 
Time: 3hrs

**Problem Statement** : Find a cycle in a directed graph and print it in ascending order of vertex involved.

**Input** : `n` `m` (number of vertices, number of edges). Then in next m lines a pair of vertices representing an edge.

**Output** : Print the cycle in ascending order of vertices involved.

**Assumptions** : If more than one cycle you can print any one of them.

**Library Functions Allowed** : Only input/output functions allowed and malloc if using C.
